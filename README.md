## My process

I started by figuring out my content boxes and then used flexbox to set everything up. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The overlay was the tricky part for me. I put some of what I learned from doing the Stats Card Challenge and a few things I found on MDN. 


### Continued development

I had trouble with the overlay, but got it figured out. So, I want to work on those skills and others.
